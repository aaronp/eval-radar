# Svelte SPA

This is a simple starting block for a new [svelte](https://svelte.dev/) single-page app.

It's the easiest baseline for creating a new sveltekit project which bundles into a static site.

To use it, just clone this repo and search and replace 'my-app-name' for your app name

## How it was made

1. followed [svelte.dev/docs/kit/creating-a-project](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/creating-a-project) with  good defaults: typescript, bun, tailwindcss
2. added node adapter, Makefile and Dockerfile
